Today I worked on:

- Creating the models, queries and routers for the pharmacies api

- I learned to utilize the authenticator in my routes.

Today I worked on:

- Worked on setting up issues to set up responsibilities for the backend API

- Worked with my team getting our project setup, all packages installed and running on Docker.

We had an 'aha' moment when we figured out we needed to run migrations down to drop the dummy tables first before we actually put our tables into the database.
