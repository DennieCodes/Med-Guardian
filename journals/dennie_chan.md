- Created a new logo for the project after we finalized on our application name: Med Guardian

- Revised layout on Top Navigation

- Optimized site images for Web

- Updated ReadMe with screenshots

## 12/01/23

- Created the Redux store for medications scheduling which is a new feature that my team and I are working on.

Good team dynamic as Michael worked on developing the calendar features which he researched and introduced, and also built out the SQL models to accommodate them. Onkur then built out the FastApi routes and queries. I built out the Redux and state management for the feature

Today I worked on:

- Researching and experimenting on different technologies to try and create a scheduler for the server to send out notifications.

## 11/29/23

Today I worked on:

- Created a component for the Add Medication page which shows the user a list of medications from the FDA

- The list is generated dynamically when a user begins typing any name into the input field

- The user can click on the name which will transfer itself to the input field.
  The reason behind this is that medication names are usually lenghty and complex so we added this feature to make it easier.

## 11/28/23

Today I worked on:

- Finished functionality for Register, Login and Profile page views

- Several back and forth merge requests, code reviews with fellow team mates

## 11/16/23

Today I worked on:

- Finished my pharmacies backend API route

- Submitted development to QA review by my teammate, Onkur

- Merged into main

Today, we will work on doing flows for the medication api route which should be the most complicated. We need to diagram some of the computations and interactions that we want for it.

## 11/15/23

Today I worked on:

- Creating the models, queries and routers for the pharmacies api

- I learned to utilize the authenticator in my routes because creating a pharmacy entry required a user to be logged in so that the pharmacy entry can be associated with them.

- We installed both globally and in VS Code black linter in order to pass CI lint tests and also to establish code style across our development

We established the use to zoom and screenshare and the FASTAPI docs utility to demonstrate correct functionality on our code as a means of code review.

## 11/14/23

Today I worked on:

- Worked on setting up issues to set up responsibilities for the backend API

- Worked with my team getting our project setup, all packages installed and running on Docker.

We had an 'aha' moment when we figured out we needed to run migrations down to drop the dummy tables first before we actually put our tables into the database.
