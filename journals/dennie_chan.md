## 11/16/23

Today I worked on:

- Finished my pharmacies backend API route

- Submitted development to QA review by my teammate, Onkur

- Merged into main

Today, we will work on doing flows for the medication api route which should be the most complicated. We need to diagram some of the computations and interactions that we want for it.

Today I worked on:

- Creating the models, queries and routers for the pharmacies api

- I learned to utilize the authenticator in my routes because creating a pharmacy entry required a user to be logged in so that the pharmacy entry can be associated with them.

- We installed both globally and in VS Code black linter in order to pass CI lint tests and also to establish code style across our development

We established the use to zoom and screenshare and the FASTAPI docs utility to demonstrate correct functionality on our code as a means of code review.

## 11/14/23

Today I worked on:

- Worked on setting up issues to set up responsibilities for the backend API

- Worked with my team getting our project setup, all packages installed and running on Docker.

We had an 'aha' moment when we figured out we needed to run migrations down to drop the dummy tables first before we actually put our tables into the database.
