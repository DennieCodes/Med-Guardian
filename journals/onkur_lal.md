Today I worked on:

- Completing a 3rd party api call and its route, this will get a list of medications from the FDA API so we can use it in our frontend.

I also talked through our medications model iwth Dennie and Micael to soldify our model and methods for it.

Today I worked on:

- Finishing up the Backend Auth and creating the api endpoints for the user profile.

I was able to complete the backend authentication with everything working properly. I also was able to complete all the routes for the user profile which include creating the profile, retrieving the profile, and updating the profile.

I had my aha moment while completing the authentication, I realized I was not returning all the required values for the response model.

Today I worked on:

- Setting up the project, which included getting PostgreSQL connected as well as PgAdmin. I also helped get the tables created and started on the Auth.

Michael, Dennie and myself all worked together to get our database created and connected to our api container. I also started to work on the user_accounts model and set up backend authentication.

We had an 'aha' moment when we figured out we needed to run migrations down to drop the dummy tables first before we actually put our tables into the database.
