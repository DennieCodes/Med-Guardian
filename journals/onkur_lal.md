Today I worked on:

- Setting up the project, which included getting PostgreSQL connected as well as PgAdmin. I also helped get the tables created and started on the Auth.

Michael, Dennie and myself all worked together to get our database created and connected to our api container. I also started to work on the user_accounts model and set up backend authentication.

We had an 'aha' moment when we figured out we needed to run migrations down to drop the dummy tables first before we actually put our tables into the database.
